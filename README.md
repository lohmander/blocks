A very rudimentary exploration of what a modern content management system could look like, stripped down to focus on a great developer & editor experience. The basic idea, at its core, is to just expose a key-value store through sensible APIs and a editing user interface. All additional fluff is to be managed as configuration; e.g., the definitions of different content types and what not. Furthermore, this should make it relatively easy to implement hot reload of everything, data, schema, everything. We'll see if it bears any fruit.
